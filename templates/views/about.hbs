        <p>This site was created by Patrick Antonio N. Castro. It uses data from mapbox.com and openweathermap.org.</p>
        <p>The creation of this site was intended for learning purposes of NodeJS with the Express framework.</p>
        <p>Not much styling went into the project. This is more on exploring the backend functionalities of NodeJS.</p>
